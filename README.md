" Amazon Clone! "
After countless hours of coding, debugging, and designing, I’ve successfully built a front-end E-commerce platform inspired by Amazon! 🌐

🔍 Key Features:
✅ User Authentication & Authorization
✅ Product Listings & Search Functionality
✅ Shopping Cart & Checkout System
✅ Responsive UI/UX

This project challenged me to dive deep into web development, master complex workflows, and fine-tune the user experience.
💡 Why this matters: It’s more than just a clone—it’s a showcase of my ability to build scalable and feature-rich applications that solve real-world problems.
